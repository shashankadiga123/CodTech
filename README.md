## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. **BMI Tracker**
The BMI Tracker app allows users to calculate their BMI using height and weight, store the records in a local database, and view a history of their BMI records.

#### 🚀 Features
- Input height (in cm) and weight (in kg) to calculate BMI.
- Store BMI records in a SQLite database.
- View a history of BMI records with timestamps.
- User-friendly graphical interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- SQLite (Database)
- Tkinter (GUI)

### 2. **Text-to-Speech Converter**
The Text-to-Speech (TTS) Converter app takes user input as text and converts it into speech using Python's `pyttsx3` library.

#### 🚀 Features
- Input any text and listen to it as speech.
- Adjust speech rate and volume for a personalized experience.
- Lightweight, offline functionality.

#### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **pyttsx3** (TTS Library)
- **Tkinter** (GUI)

#### 📋 Libraries Used
- **Tkinter**
- **SQLite**
- **pyttsx3**
- **Pillow** (for advanced GUI features, optional)

#### 📚 Future Enhancements

**BMI Tracker**:
- Add data visualization (e.g., graph of BMI trends over time).
- Support for user authentication for multiple users.

**Text-to-Speech**:
- Add support for different languages and voices.
- Allow saving the audio output to a file.
